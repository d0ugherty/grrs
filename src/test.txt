Oh! Santiana gained a day
Away Santiana!
"Napoleon of the West", they say
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

She's a fast clipper ship and a bully good crew
Away Santiana!
And an old salty yank for a captain too
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

Santiana fought for gold
Away Santiana!
Around Cape Horn through the ice and snow
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

T'was on the field of Molly-Del-Ray
Away Santiana!
Well both his legs got blown away
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

It was a fierce and bitter strife
Away Santiana!
The general Taylor took his life
Along the plains of Mexico

Well, heave 'er up and away we'll go
Away Santiana!
Heave 'er up and away we'll go
Along the plains of Mexico

Santiana, now we mourn
Away Santiana!
We left him buried off Cape Horn
Along the plains of Mexico
